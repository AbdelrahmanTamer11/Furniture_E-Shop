🚀 FurniVision - Localhost Troubleshooting Guide
================================================

✅ GOOD NEWS: Your server IS working on localhost:8000!

🔍 VERIFICATION COMPLETED:
- ✅ Server is running on port 8000
- ✅ HTTP requests are successful (Status 200 OK)
- ✅ Files are accessible via localhost:8000
- ✅ VS Code Simple Browser can access the site

🌐 WORKING URLs (Verified):
- http://localhost:8000/status.html     ← System status page
- http://localhost:8000/index.html      ← Main furniture store
- http://localhost:8000/diagnostic.html ← Testing suite
- http://localhost:8000/simple.html     ← AI demo

🛠️ IF LOCALHOST:8000 DOESN'T WORK IN YOUR BROWSER:

1. 🔄 BROWSER CACHE ISSUE
   Solution: Press Ctrl+F5 to force refresh
   Or: Open in incognito/private mode

2. 🔒 BROWSER SECURITY SETTINGS
   - Some browsers block localhost connections
   - Try: Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
   - Enable "Allow insecure localhost" in Chrome

3. 🌐 USE ALTERNATIVE ADDRESSES:
   - http://127.0.0.1:8000/status.html
   - http://[::1]:8000/status.html (IPv6)

4. 🚫 FIREWALL/ANTIVIRUS BLOCKING
   - Temporarily disable Windows Firewall
   - Check antivirus settings
   - Add Python.exe to allowed applications

5. 🔌 PORT CONFLICTS
   If port 8000 is busy, the server will automatically try:
   - Port 8001: http://localhost:8001/
   - Port 8080: http://localhost:8080/

6. 🐍 RESTART SERVER OPTIONS:

   Option A - Quick Start (Double-click):
   📂 Double-click: quick-start.bat

   Option B - Command Line:
   📋 Open PowerShell in frontend folder:
   python -m http.server 8000

   Option C - Our Custom Server:
   python test-server.py

7. 📱 DIRECT FILE ACCESS (Always Works):
   - Open Windows Explorer
   - Navigate to: frontend folder
   - Double-click: status.html
   - Works offline, no server needed!

🔍 ADVANCED DEBUGGING:

Check if server is running:
  netstat -an | findstr :8000

Test with curl:
  curl http://localhost:8000/

Kill any stuck processes:
  taskkill /f /im python.exe

📋 QUICK SOLUTIONS SUMMARY:

✅ Method 1: Direct File Access
   📁 frontend/status.html (double-click)

✅ Method 2: VS Code Simple Browser
   🌐 Use VS Code's built-in browser

✅ Method 3: Alternative IP
